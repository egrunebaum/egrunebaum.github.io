      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <h2>Why Bonbids?</h2>
      <h4>.......</h4>

      <p style="padding-bottom:2rem">This project was completed as a part of Beginex, a 12 week User Experience Design program that partners UX/UI Designers with non-profit organizations. The client my group was assigned to was Bonbids, an online fundraising
        platform where users participate in a timed auction that allows them to support causes they care about in a fun way, and win prizes for themselves in the process.<br />
        <br />While Bonbids was already live, the client enlisted us to delve into the design and suggest ways in which the platform could be improved. My group of 4 people was tasked with focusing on improving the onboarding
        process for new users.

    <!--THE CHALLENGE-->
    <div class="section">

      <h3>The Challenge</h3>
      <h2>What Problems am I Solving for?</h2>
      <h4>.......</h4>

      <p>
        The goal of this project was to improve the user onboarding process. Though a seemingly small task, user onboarding is paramount to a product and, as defined by <a href="https://www.trychameleon.com/blog/what-is-user-onboarding" class="link"
          target="_blank">Chameleon,</a> is "the system of actively guiding users to find new value in [the] product."
        <br /><br />
        User research showed us that the value of Bonbids lay in users understanding how the game worked, and feeling connected and engaged to their cause.

      </p>


      <!--THE SOLUTION-->
      <div class="section">

        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <h2>Understand the Game & Feel Connected to the Cause</h2>
        <h4>.......</h4>

        <p>Based on the insights gleaned from our user research, we focused on creating a user-centric and transparent onboarding process by:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <div class="bonbid-bullet">
            <li>More clearly explaining how the game works and creating a greater sense of connection to their cause.</li>
          </div>
          <div class="bonbid-bullet">
            <li>Walking donors through onboarding using non-fundraiser terminology, providing them with more flexibility in payments, and transparency about how their donation would be used.</li>
          </div>
          <div class="bonbid-bullet">
            <li>Creating a visually consistent and structurally simple onboarding process.</li>

      <h3>Competitive analysis</h3>
      <h2>Learning From Existing Solutions</h2>
      <h4>.......</h4>

      <p>After figuring out the challenges we were solving for, we jumped right into researching competitor sites so that we could understand where Bonbids fit into the market and learn from the strengths and weaknesses of competitor’s own
        onboarding process.

    <!--USER RESEARCH-->
    <div class="section">
      <h3>User research</h3>
      <h2>Clarifying Users' Expectations & Frustrations</h2>
      <h4>.......</h4>

      <p>
        Our timeframe for completing this project was very limited. Combined with the fact that the target demographic was very specific (parents with children enrolled in a school program), our user research focused on <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E6QqO9WP6cU18nU1brvM6IoAkXgPkqlA"
          class="link">interviewing users,</a> questioning their montivations for making online donations, and testing the usability of the current Bonbids onboarding process. <br />We interviewed five uers in total, all of whom were a parent of
        middle school aged children
        who had made an online donation to their children's school within the last year.
      </p>
      <p>Through our user research we identified 3 key themes that caused users to experience frustrations during the onboarding process:
      </p><br /><br />
      <ol>

        <li>
          <span class="gold-bold">User-centricity & personalization

        <div class="bonbid-bullet-ol">
          <ul>
            <li> Users were confused by the language and fundraising terminology. </li>
            <li> Users wanted flexibility and greater options in initial payment packages. </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <li>
          <span class="gold-bold">Simplicity & consistency</span></li>
        <div class="bonbid-bullet-ol">
          <ul>
            <li> The onboarding steps and rationale for certain requirements were unclear. </li>
            <li> Visual inconsistencies in the website design confused users. </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <li><span class="gold-bold">Engagement</span></li>
        <div class="bonbid-bullet-ol">
          <ul>
            <li> Lack of reminders and clear next steps after onboarding hindered user participation. </li>
            <li> Users wanted to feel a closer connection to the causes they were donating to. </li>

      <h3>User persona</h3>
      <h2>Bringing a Bonbids User to Life</h2>
      <h4>.......</h4>

      <p>With the information gained from our competitive analysis and user research, we put together a user persona, a hypothetical archetype of a real Bonbids user as defined by their motivations, goals, and frustrations. Building personas
        allowed us to summarize the patterns we noticed and give them life in the form of a fictional user.</p>

      <h3>User stories & flows</h3>
      <h2>Redesigning the Onboarding User Flow</h2>
      <h4>.......</h4>

      <p>The original user flow separated the "How it Works" section from the onboarding process, requiring users to navigate away in order to learn how the Bonbids game worked. It also asked users to select a Bonbids package before getting them
        to sign up and create an account.</p>

      </div>

      <p> Our user research indicated that it was important for users to understand how the game worked before they signed up, so we knew we needed to rework the user flow to incorporate the "How it Works" section. <br /><br />Observing seven users
        go through the original flow live on the site, we believed users would be more likely to complete the sign-up process if they selected their Bonbids package after creating their account, instead of before. <p class="gold-bold">  Based on our observations, goals of our redesigned user flow were to:
      </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Incorporate an explanation of how the Bonbids game worked into the onboarding user flow.
          </li>
          <li>
            Have users create an account before choosing their Bonbids package.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          With these goals in mind, we started by creating rough sketches of the ideal onboarding flow using paper and then worked through it in more detail by whiteboarding.</p>

      <h3>User Testing</h3>

      <p>
        Nine users tested the different versions of our redesigned onboarding. We then synthesized their feedback to guide further iterations.</p><br />
      <p>
        Changes we made based on user feedback included:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p class="gold-bold">Iteration on the user flow, separating the "How it Works" section from the onboarding landing page. </p>

            Consistent feedback was that the game was extremely confusing, and we noticed users sometimes skipping over the "How it Works" section when it was included on the onboarding page. Separating the page out resulted in users actually
            reading the text, allowing them to better understand the value of the game and how to play, making them more inclined to complete the full onboarding proces.

            moving on wth the onboarding process. Because of these two reasons, we decided to get rid of the "next" and "previous" buttons.

            Users continuously relayed the importance of seeing exactly where their donation was going to go, stating that if this information wasn't conveyed, they would be less inclined to donate. Because of this we added a section to the fundraiser landing page and the "Choose Your Package" page that clearly showed how their donation would be used. Our hope was that this would also entice them to increase their donation.

We designed for this, but our felt strongly that having them donate without playing the game was not within the scope of their business plan. Because of this, combined with the very limited time we had to complete this project, we removed the option for users to donate without playing the game in our final design.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p class="gold-bold">Stay within the scope of your project.</p>
          We would continually remind ourselves the scope of our assigned project (solely to work on user onboarding), as we had a strong inclination to redesign pages outside of the onboarding process that we felt effected it, including the
          homepage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="gold-bold">Keep the explanation of how the product works simple.</p>
          The biggest challenge in improving the onboarding process was getting users to understand how Bonbids worked. The original design attempted to explain every single aspect of the game which overloaded users, confusing them and dissuading
          them from completing the onboarding process. Our solution to this was to only highlight the most important aspects of the game - just enough for users to see the value in the product and understand how to play.
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="gold-bold">Choosing the right language is extremly important when explaining product features.</p>
          Though the product-specific terminology in the original design was creative, it was confusing to users and didn't encourage them to participate.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="gold-bold">Have continuous communication with your client and know your client always has the last word.</p>
          Our client had a very specific business plan in mind for Bonbids that effected the design. We provided her with user research showing it might be in her favor to reconsider certain aspects of it, but she was adament in not making those changes which we had to heed and respect.
        </li>
      </ol>

<p>

      If I had had more time, I would have loved to continue testing our redesigned onboarding process and see if it resulted in any improvement in the bounce rate, and number of new users per month. I also would have loved to continue working on the UI as our focus, rightfully so, had been on the UX.
