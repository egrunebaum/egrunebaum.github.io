  <h3>Summary</h3>
<h2>Why Assemble?</h2>
<h4>. . . . . . . .</h4>
<p>Cloud storage applications is a growing market that people are increasingly reliant on it for both personal and professional use. In 2018 an estimated 3.6 billion people worldwide used cloud storage, up from 1.8 billion people in 2017. With so
  many cloud storage users, there is an opportunity for a new, updated product to enter the market that resolves frustrations current users experience. Assemble seeks to do this by improving discoverability and giving users the ability to gather all
  of their file, teams, and inspiration from across the web in one, easy-to-use interface.</p>

  <!-- Overview -->
    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <h2>What Problems am I Solving for?</h2>
    <h4>. . . . . . . .</h4>
  <p>For this project, I was tasked with building a cloud storage brand and app that stood out in the saturated market. The client did not have a specific vision in mind for the direction to go and was reliant on me to discover the problems that
    existed for current users that the competition had yet to address. The research I conducted allowed me to see a pattern of frustrations that users experienced when using their cloud storage app of choice:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Difficulty in finding files.</li>
    <li>Needing to switch between accounts/applications when dealing with personal and professional files</li>
    <li>Inability to save inspiration and information from across the web that would be helpful to complete personal and professional projects.</li>
  </ul>

    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <h2>Simplicity & Increased Functionality</h2>
<h4>. . . . . . . .</h4>
  <p>I relied on my research and competitive analysis to guide how I would best resolve the frustrations that users faced. The research clued me into users’ current behaviors when using cloud storage applications. The competitive analysis allowed me
    to understand the strengths and weakness of the competitors in the space, enabling me to see what opportunities existed. Combining the outcome of my research and competitive analysis, I focused on the following as solutions to the challenges my
    product was to resolve:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Design a simple, intuitive dashboard with a simplified information architecture.</li>
    <li>Create a separate section for users to use when dealing with their personal files and files associate with projects they are collaborating on with others.</li>
    <li>Integrate the functionality of being able to save links.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Design Process -->
  
    <h3>User research</h3>
    <h2>Understanding Users' Expectations & Frustrations</h2>
  <h4>. . . . . . . .</h4>
  <p>Now that I had an idea of what opportunities existed for Assemble, I needed to determine the best way to design solutions to the challenges I had discovered users faced.To do this, I first had to get to know my users better. What were their
    preferences, opinions and behaviors as related to cloud storage applications? I used a user survey to gather this information, sending it out to friends, family, subreddit groups and my fellow Bloc students. The user survey focused on the
    following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What users used cloud storage for.</li>
    <li>The specific cloud storage applications favored by users.</li>
    <li>What users liked most about their cloud storage application of choice and what their top frustrations were.</li>
    <li>Features they found most important to have.</li>
    <li>Absent features they wished they had.</li>
    <li>How they would optimally organize their content.</li>
    </ul>

  <!--<div class="surveys">
    <img src="images/survey1.png" alt="survey1">
  </div>-->

  <p>After reviewing my key findings, I had a solid vision for the product I wanted to build, but I still had areas I wanted more certainty on. And who better to get that certainty from than users! So I put together another survey which I sent out
    to the users who had said I could reach back out to them if I had any further questions. The focus of this survey was to do a deeper dive on features users wanted, but I also wanted to know if users primarily used their desktop or mobile phone
    to access to their cloud storage so I knew what platform to design towards.</p>

  <h3>User personas</h3>
  <h2>Bringing Users to Life</h2>
  <h4>. . . . . . . .</h4>
  <p>With the information gained from my competitive analysis and my user surveys, I was ready to create my user personas, hypothetical archetypes of real users as defined by their goals and frustrations. Building personas would allow me to
    summarize the patterns I noticed and give them life in the form of fictional users.</p>
  <!--ADD PERSONAS-->

  <h3>User stories & flows</h3>
  <h2>Seeing it in the Context of the User</h2>
  <h4>. . . . . . . .</h4>
  <p>Keeping the user personas in mind, I created user stories which laid out the highest, medium and lowest priority tasks for users. I focused on the highest and medium priority tasks to create my medium viable product (MVP) which I then mapped
    out using user flows.</p>
  <!--add user stories and flows-->


    <h3>Low fidelity wireframes</h3>
    <h2>Building the Skeletal Structure</h2>
    <h4>. . . . . . . .</h4>
  <p>After conducting research and creating user stories and flows, I was ready to build the skeletal structure of Assemble with wireframes. To do this, I first put pen to paper and created a basic concept of how Assemble would look and work, paying
    attention to what users would see on each screen that would lead them to the desired result mapped out in my user stories. I then transformed my sketches into wireframes. Because 95% of surveyed users reported using their cloud storage mainly on
    their computer as opposed to their mobile device, I built a desktop-first design. <br><br> I ended up redoing my first iteration after completing user testing and having users report feeling “overloaded” which was part of the challenge I was
    seeking to solve for in the first place. My second iteration focused on simpler information architecture, with primary and secondary categories and each screen focused on one particular area.</p>

    <h3>Brand logo</h3>
    <h2>Creating a Brand Identity</h2>
    <h4>. . . . . . . .</h4>
  </header>
  <p>I considered two names when building this app but ultimately chose Assemble because it directly conveyed the action that users would take when using the application: to assemble files, teams, and links. It applied to both the personal and
    professional user and, a verb, Assemble elicited the emotional response in users to be active in using the platform. And it was a name no other company was using in the market. <br><br>After deciding on the name, I worked on designing a logo.
    Although I had an idea of the direction I wanted to go, the first step I took in creating the logo was to complete a mind mapping exercise. This allowed me to fully lay out the emotions central to Assemble that I wanted users to feel when seeing
    the logo.<br><br>To keep the branding clear, all of the logo iterations I created played on the idea of people/ideas coming together around a cloud where all their information would be stored. I used preference tests to decide which logo
    iteration to use. The one that was ultimately chosen was created by using golden ratio circles. It was chosen because it was simple, straightforward and cheerful; it also received the most positive reactions from users when tested.</p>

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <h2>Evoking the Right Emotions</h2>
    <h4>. . . . . . . .</h4>
  </header>
  <p>When deciding what color palette I wanted to use, I first considered the emotions I wanted users to feel: trustworthy, calm, creative and successful. With this in mind, I chose a color palette that included blue, green, purple, white and gray.
    I wanted the tones to be vibrant enough to keep the user engaged and uplifted, but soft enough to create a sense of ease and calm.<br><br>I chose blue as the primary color because it evokes the emotions of serenity, trustworthiness, and
    intelligence. Blue puts the user in a peaceful state making it an ideal color to follow the user throughout their flows with its calming influence lending to them be able to be more productive.</p>

  <header class="header-container">
    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <h2>Keeping the Design Systematic</h2>
    <h4>. . . . . . . .</h4>
  </header>
  <p>When choosing the typography, I focused on finding a typeface for the logo and primary text which matched the logo’s rounded shapes and which was easily legible. I chose Open Sans for the primary typeface for its clean, well-balanced, rounded
    geometric shapes.<br><br>For the logo, I chose Montserrat which matches Open Sans’ rounded shapes and has an elegant simplicity and character that makes it stand out.<br><br><br>
    <p style="font-family: Montserrat; font-weight: 500">Montserrat Medium for the logo</p><br><br>
    <p style="font-family: Open Sans; font-weight: 600">Open Sans SemiBold for H1 text</p><br>
    <p style="font-family: Open Sans; font-weight: 600">Open Sans Normal for H2 text</p>

      <h2>Creating Visual Elements</h2>
      <h4>. . . . . . . .</h4>

    <p>I wanted to use illustrations on my homepage to convey the concepts of Assemble in a way that was informative and fun. To make the illustrations, I used several different vector illustrations from freepik.com.</p>

    <p>Keeping in mind my branding, it was time to put the skin on my wereframes and make them fully come to life.</p>

      <h3>User Testing</h3>
      <h2>Testing the Usability</h2>
      <h4>. . . . . . . .</h4>
    </header>
    <p>Using my high fideltiy prototype, I conducted scenario-based usability tests in-person and virtually to assess the product’s usability and to assess the user’s preferences towards specific pages. I then took the findings and made changes to
      my design.</p>
    <!--1/2 image-->
    <ol>
      <li>When I gave users the task of sorting files, the majority didn’t see this at first and tried to click on the “Name,” “Last Edited” or “File Created.” Based on this, I changed it so that users could sort by clicking on the words, with an
        arrow showing the direction they’re sorted by (A - Z, First to Last).</li>
      <li>“To-Do” was a feature I held on to until the end, but ultimately decided to remove based on extensive user feedback. While in my survey, participants stated they would like a to-do functionality, when testing the product users reported
        that they wouldn’t use a to-do section, citing it “unnecessary.” I tried different iterations but keeping in mind one of my goals of keeping the interface simple, I ultimately decided to remove it.</li>
    </ol>
    <!--uploading a file images-->
    <p>When going through the task of uploading a file, users reported that they did not find it ideal for it to take over the entire screen, disabling them from doing anything while files uploaded. They also wanted to be able to to open their newly
      uploaded files without having to search for it. With this feedback, I iterated on the uploading process. Users responded to the new iteration very positively.</p>
    <!--exiting out a document images-->
    <p>When given the task of opening a file and then canceling out of it, users always took a noticeable amount of time when the prompt was to click “close.” While I thought the “close” would be very obvious and clear, users reported that their
      eyes remained at the top where the other text was so it was hard to see. For this reason, I changed the prompt to a back arrow. Testing proved this to be a positive change as users completed the task much quicker across the board.</p>

      <h3>In Conlusion</h3>
      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <h4>. . . . . . . .</h4>
    </header>
    <p>This was my first full design project and it was an incredible learning experience. These are the biggest lessons I learned:<br><br></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p style="font-weight: 300">Stick to the challenges you are trying to resolve and don’t try to tackle everything.</p> Going into this project, I was uncertain of what direction to take, and the open-ended client brief didn’t help. I wanted
        to create a “perfect” product, and I wrongly thought that I could only do this by having it tackle ALL the problems that existed. By trying to address all of the problems, I lost sight of the original challenges I was designing for.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="font-weight: 300">When you’re feeling stuck, review your research and personas. Don’t fall into the trap of getting yourself unstuck by merely going with what you think is best. All decisions need to be rooted in research, with
          empathy for your users.</p>Several times I found myself designing based on what I thought was best, only to review my research and realize I needed to go in a different direction. This cost me a lot of time and frustration.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="font-weight: 300">Test every iteration, no matter how tedious. Don’t assume your latest iteration is the best one. But know when to move on as well.</p> There were several times when I found myself iterating on a feature so many
        times that I lost track of both my original goal and valuable time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="font-weight: 300">Make sure your user flows represent the MVP of your product.</p>I made the mistake of creating flows that were a high priority but weren’t the flows that made my product unique. Going forward I will make sure that
        the flows I create are the ones that directly display what makes my product stand out from the competition.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="font-weight: 300">Be inspired and learn from others but don’t let it completely change your direction every time.</p>There were several times where I would see someone else’s project, and it would cause me to change what I was
        working on completely. The main problem for this is that I didn’t know what their project was solving for, which often meant I would design something that did not work for the frustrations I was designing for.
      </li>
