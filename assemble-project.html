      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <h2>Why Assemble?</h2>
      <h4>.......</h4>

        <p style="padding-bottom:2rem">Cloud storage applications is a growing market that people are increasingly reliant on it for both personal and professional use. In 2018 an estimated 3.6 billion people worldwide used cloud storage, up from
          1.8
          billion people in 2017.
          With
          so many cloud storage users, there is an opportunity for a new, updated product to enter the market that resolves frustrations current users experience. Assemble seeks to do this by improving discoverability and giving users the ability to
          gather all of their file, teams, and inspiration from across the web in one, easy-to-use interface.</p>

    <div class="section">

      <h3>The Challenge</h3>
      <h2>What Problems am I Solving for?</h2>
      <h4>.......</h4>

        <p>For this project, I was tasked with building a cloud storage brand and app that stood out in the saturated market. The client did not have a specific vision in mind for the direction to go and was reliant on me to discover the problems
          that existed for current users that the competition had yet to address. The research I conducted allowed me to see a pattern of frustrations that users experienced when using their cloud storage app of choice:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Difficulty in finding files.</li>
          <li>Needing to switch between accounts/applications when dealing with personal and professional files.</li>
          <li>Inability to save inspiration and information from across the web that would be helpful to complete personal and professional projects.</li>
        </ul>

</div>

      <!--THE SOLUTION

      <div class="section">

        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <h2>Simplicity & Increased Functionality</h2>
        <h4>.......</h4>

          <p>I relied on my research and competitive analysis to guide how I would best resolve the frustrations that users faced. The research clued me into users’ current behaviors when using cloud storage applications. The competitive analysis
            allowed me to understand the strengths and weakness of the competitors in the space, enabling me to see what opportunities existed. Combining the outcome of my research and competitive analysis, I focused on the following as solutions to
            the
            challenges
            my product was to resolve:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Design a simple, intuitive dashboard with a simplified information architecture.</li>
            <li>Create a separate section for users to use when dealing with their personal files and files associate with projects they are collaborating on with others.</li>
            <li>Integrate the functionality of being able to save links.</li>
          </ul>

      <h2>Learning From Existing Solutions</h2>
      <h4>.......</h4>

        <p>To discover how to best position Assemble in the saturated market, I needed to first understand the strengths and weakness of the competitors that already existed in the space. After doing some research and determining <b>Google, Dropbox,
            and
            Pinterest</b> were 3 of the most popular, I decided to use them to conduct my competitive analysis.</p>

      <h3>User research</h3>
      <h2>Clarifying Users' Expectations & Frustrations</h2>
      <h4>.......</h4>
        <p>Now that I had an idea of what opportunities existed for Assemble, I needed to determine the best way to design solutions to the challenges I had discovered users faced. To do this, I first had to get to know my users better. What were
          their
          preferences, opinions and behaviors as related to cloud storage applications? I used a user survey to gather this information, sending it out to friends, family, subreddit groups and my fellow Bloc students. The user survey focused on the
          following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What users used cloud storage for.</li>
          <li>The specific cloud storage applications favored by users.</li>
          <li>What users liked most about their cloud storage application of choice and what their top frustrations were.</li>
          <li>Features they found most important to have.</li>
          <li>Absent features they wished they had.</li>
          <li>How they would optimally organize their content.</li>

      <p>
        After reviewing my key findings, I had a solid vision for the product I wanted to build, but I still had areas I wanted more certainty on. And who better to get that certainty from than users! So I put together another survey which I sent
        out to the users who had said I could reach back out to them if I had any further questions. The focus of this survey was to do a deeper dive on features users wanted, but I also wanted to know if users primarily used their desktop or mobile
        phone to access to their cloud storage so I knew what platform to design towards.

      <h2>Building the Skeletal Structure</h2>
      <h4>.......</h4>

        <p>After conducting research and creating user stories and flows, I was ready to build the skeletal structure of Assemble with wireframes. To do this, I first put pen to paper and created a basic concept of how Assemble would look and work,
          paying attention to what users would see on each screen that would lead them to the desired result mapped out in my user stories. Because 95% of surveyed users reported using their cloud
          storage mainly on their computer as opposed to their mobile device, I built a desktop-first design. I then transformed my sketches into wireframes. <br><br> I ended up completely redoing my <a href="https://invis.io/NYMWAYW2X57" class="link">first
            iteration</a> after completing user testing and having users
          report feeling “overloaded” which was part of
          the
          challenge I was seeking to solve for in the first place. My second iteration focused on a more simple information architecture, with primary and secondary categories and each screen focused on one particular area.</p>

        <p>I considered two names when building this app but ultimately chose Assemble because it directly conveyed the action that users would take when using the application: to assemble files, teams, and links. It applied to both the personal and professional user and, a verb, Assemble elicited the emotional response in users to be active in using the platform. It was also a name no other company was using in the market. <br><br>
        After deciding on the name, I worked on designing a logo. Although I had an idea of the direction I wanted to go, the first step I took in creating the logo was to complete a<b> mind mapping exercise. </b>This allowed me to fully lay out the emotions central to Assemble that I wanted users to feel when seeing the logo.<br><br>To keep the branding clear, all of the logo iterations I created played on the idea of people/ideas coming together around a cloud where all their information would be stored. I used a preference test to help me decide which logo iteration to use. The one that was ultimately chosen was <b>created by using golden ratio circles.</b> It was chosen because it was simple, straightforward and cheerful; it also received the <a href="https://app.usabilityhub.com/tests/c8ac8a81e43a/results/5185ae974f3b"

            <p><img src="images/2.svg" style="margin: 1rem 1rem 0 0">“To-Do” was a feature I held on to until the end, but ultimately decided to remove based on extensive user feedback. While in my survey, participants stated they would like a to-do
              functionality, when testing the product users reported
              that they wouldn’t use a to-do section, citing it “unnecessary.” I tried different iterations but keeping in mind one of my goals of keeping the interface simple, I ultimately decided to remove it.</p>

        click “close.” While I thought the “close” would be very obvious and clear, users reported that their
        eyes remained at the top where the other text was so it was hard to see. For this reason, I changed the prompt to a back arrow. Testing proved this to be a positive change as users completed the task much quicker across the board.

          <p>This was my first full design project and it was an incredible learning experience. These are the biggest lessons I learned:<br></p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p class="conclusion">Stick to the challenges you are trying to resolve and don’t try to tackle everything.</p> Going into this project, I was uncertain of what direction to take, and the open-ended client brief didn’t help. I wanted
              to create a “perfect” product, and I wrongly thought that I could only do this by having it tackle ALL the problems that existed. By trying to address all of the problems, I lost sight of the original challenges I was designing for.
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="conclusion">When you’re feeling stuck, review your research and personas. Don’t fall into the trap of getting yourself unstuck by merely going with what you think is best. All decisions need to be rooted in research, with
                empathy for your users.</p>Several times I found myself designing based on what I thought was best, only to review my research and realize I needed to go in a different direction. This cost me a lot of time and frustration.
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="conclusion">Test every iteration, no matter how tedious. Don’t assume your latest iteration is the best one. But know when to move on as well.</p> There were several times when I found myself iterating on a feature so many
              times that I lost track of both my original goal and valuable time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="conclusion">Make sure your user flows represent the MVP of your product.</p>I made the mistake of creating flows that were a high priority but weren’t the flows that made my product unique. Going forward I will make sure
              that
              the flows I create are the ones that directly display what makes my product stand out from the competition.
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="conclusion">Be inspired and learn from others but don’t let it completely change your direction every time.</p>There were several times where I would see someone else’s project, and it would cause me to change what I was
              working on completely. The main problem for this is that I didn’t know what their project was solving for, which often meant I would design something that did not work for the frustrations I was designing for.
